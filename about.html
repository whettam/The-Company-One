        <h3>Tucked away underneath North Grand Ave in a seemingly abandoned warehouse lies one of the oldest and
            scariest haunted attractions in Springfield, MO: Dungeons of Doom. They brought new life to the Dungeons
            this 2022 season with redesigns, fun photo-op opportunities, a 16 ft live snake, and so much more!! Guests
            can expect an aggressive, in-your-face experience with many disturbing twists and turns, and recurring
            guests like myself will experience all the newest additions and changes that give it a fresh coat of paint!

            Dungeons of Doom is one of two haunted attractions, but it stands on its own as a genuinely frightening
            experience. The monsters within are waiting for new victims to claim, each with their special way of toying
            with guests who dare enter. Want to know what’s new and what to expect? Keep reading to find out more! -
